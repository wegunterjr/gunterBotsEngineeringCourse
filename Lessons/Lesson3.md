Engineering Design Cycle - (continued)
1. Research Criteria/Constraints
1. Brainstorm possible solutions

Discovered issues with pricing due to shipping and import taxes!  WOOOO!!!  

Might consider alternatives, like using hoverboard motors since they are in-hub motors and might be more available.
