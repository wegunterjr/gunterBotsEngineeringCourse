Programming Intro

This is where you put life into all the things.   Want to make something move, repeat itself over and over again, respoond to a sensor, or bring you a treat from the fridge! Or you can press a button and make something appear in minecraft or when you walk around a certain place in Minecraft and make something in the real world happen, turn on an LED, launch a rocket, glitter bomb. Etc!  SO MUCH FUN!!!  

Things interacting with the real world!

THis is where that happens!!!

There are a bunch of ways to do this from blocks to words.  We will use blocks to start and go over basic programming techniques, loops, inputs, outputs, and logic.
