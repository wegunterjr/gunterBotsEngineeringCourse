## This is a video of converting a hoverboard into a onewheel using 3d printed parts

Some Challenges with the hoverboard approach is that a lot of available hover boards have 6.5" wheels :unamused:.  Will make the deck lower to the ground, but might be some options to lift the deck but could be off-balance.

Take the two hoverboard motors and make one wheel. The two motors will serve as the internal hub and will need a larger wheel.
